Elo Ratings -> Final Score + Where it was played (home/away)
- Gain points for winning, lose points for losing (upsets = higher margins)
- Zero sum system (same amount of points added to winning team and subtracted from losing team)
- Ratings go off of a game by game basis

Elo K-Factor: How quickly the rating reacts to new results 
- Essentially we want to react to new results but not to overreact (minimize autocorrelation)
- If K too high -> ratings jump around a bunch
- If K too low -> Elo takes too long to recognize change
- Optimal K is 20 (Give a lot of weight to recent team performance)

Home Court Advantage = 100 Elo points (equivalent to 3.5 NBA points)

Margin of Victory: You gain or lose more Elo points dependent on the margin of victory
- Formula accounts for diminishing returns (starting to win by less matters more than the opposite)

Year to Year Carry Over: Team retains 3/4 of their rating into the next year
- This is due to the fact that NBA teams tend to be more consistent year to year 

Inaugural Season: Start with 1300 score
